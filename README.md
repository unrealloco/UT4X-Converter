If not, make sure you have installed latest Java tecknology version at www.java.com
and create some "run.bat" batch file with notepad that you will save in the

How to convert map?
------------------------------
Make sure you are allowed to convert the original map (if you are not the original author for example)

In UT99 Editor:
- Open the Unreal Tournament (1999) Editor
- Open the map you want to convert 
(note if it does not seems to load (on Windows Vista/7/8/+), copy map to some folder without spaces and re-open)
- Export and save map to Unreal Text map using menu "File -> Export"

In UT4 Converter:
- Launch UT4 Converter
- Go to "Convert -> UT99 Map"
- Select the .t3d map file you have just saved before and press OK.

In UT4 Editor:
- Open the UT4 Editor
- Create new level ("File -> New level ...") and select "Empty level"
- Create an additive brush to simulate subtractive level: (Unreal Engine 4 does not support levels in "Subtract" mode)
-- Go to "Modes" panel (left top of screen)
-- Go to "BSP"
-- Drag and drop a "Box" in the map
- Import converted map
-- "File -> Import ..."
-- Select the file and click on OK to import the map
- Rebuid Geometry ("Build" -> "Build Geometry")
- Re-size the additive brush so the entire level fits in the brush

Optional:
Select all surfaces of the brush in additive mode added (select one surface + press "Ctrl+B"
Change "LightMap Resolution" from 32 to 1024.
This will save a lot of filesize space for the map ! (and outside of that brush is never displayed to player)

Note:
For some maps you may have to use subtractive brushes before importing level.
This depends mainly on layout of map (outdoor map such as CTF-Face and so on ...)
